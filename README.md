This example demonstrates a subtle type inference issue in Scala when working with generic classes and methods that accept functions as parameters. The issue arises because of the different behavior of the + operator for different types (numeric addition vs. string concatenation).  The `bug.scala` file showcases the problem, and the `bugSolution.scala` provides a solution using type constraints or explicitly specifying the function's return type.
